## Details

*Degree* : For a node, the degree is the number of edge connections it has.  Each time a node is referenced as `source` or `target` of an edge in the graph, that counts as an edge connection.

*Indegree* : For a node, the indegree is the number of incoming edge connections it has.  Each time a node is referred to as `target` of an edge in the graph, that counts as an incoming edge connection.

*Outdegree* : For a node, the outdegree is the number of outgoing edge connections it has.  Each time a node is referred to as `source` of an edge in the graph, that counts as an outgoing edge connection.

*Total degree* : For a set of nodes, the total degree is the total number of edge connections to nodes in the set.
