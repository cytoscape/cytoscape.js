This function is useful for running a layout on a subset of the elements in the graph, perhaps in parallel to other layouts.

You must specify `options.name` with the name of the layout you wish to use.

This function creates and returns a [layout object](#layouts).  You may want to keep a reference to the layout for more advanced usecases, such as running multiple layouts simultaneously. 

<span class="important-indicator"></span> Note that you must call [`layout.run()`](#layouts/layout-manipulation/layout.run) in order for it to affect the graph.

## Examples

```js
var layout = cy.elements().makeLayout({
  name: 'random'
});

layout.run();
```
