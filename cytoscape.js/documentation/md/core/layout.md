## Details

For layouts included with Cytoscape.js, you can find their options documented in the [Layouts section](#layouts).  For external layouts, please refer to their accompanying documentation.

An analogue to run a layout on a subset of the graph exists as [`eles.layout()`](#collection/layout/eles.layout).

## Examples

Run the grid layout:

```js
cy.layout({ name: 'grid' });
```
