Please note that although we offer downloads of previous versions of Cytoscape.js, you should use the latest version whenever possible.  The old versions are provided for legacy reasons (i.e. you started your app with an old version of Cytoscape.js), but we strongly suggest you use the latest version.

If there's a bug or other issue preventing you from using the latest version of Cytoscape.js, we would love your feedback so we could support your use case.  Please [make a ticket](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js/issues/new) in the issue tracker.
