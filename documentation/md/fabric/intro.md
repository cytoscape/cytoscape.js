A fabric is a collection of threads that can be used together in a collaborative fashion for multitasking purposes, thereby increasing the overall speed of execution of parallel code.  A fabric may be created as follows:

```js
var fabric = cytoscape.fabric();
```

The `new` keyword and class-style uppercase naming are optional, so you may alternatively do as follows:

```js
var fabric = new cytoscape.Fabric();
```
