## About

Cytoscape.js is an open-source [graph theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) (a.k.a. network) library written in JavaScript.  You can use Cytoscape.js for graph analysis and visualisation.

Cytoscape.js allows you to easily display and manipulate rich, interactive graphs.  Because Cytoscape.js allows the user to interact with the graph and the library allows the client to hook into user events, Cytoscape.js is easily integrated into your webapp, especially since Cytoscape.js supports both desktop browsers, like Chrome, and mobile browsers, like on the iPad.  Cytoscape.js includes all the gestures you would expect out-of-the-box, including pinch-to-zoom, box selection, panning, et cetera.

Cytoscape.js also has graph analysis in mind:  The library contains many useful functions in graph theory.  You can use Cytoscape.js headlessly on Node.js to do graph analysis in the terminal or on a web server.

Cytoscape.js is an open-source project, and anyone is free to contribute.  For more information, refer to the [GitHub README](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js).

The library was developed at the [Donnelly Centre](http://thedonnellycentre.utoronto.ca) at the [University of Toronto](http://www.utoronto.ca/).  It is the successor of [Cytoscape Web](http://cytoscapeweb.cytoscape.org/).



## Cytoscape.js & Cytoscape

Though Cytoscape.js shares its name with [Cytoscape](http://www.cytoscape.org/), Cytoscape.js is not exactly the same as Cytoscape desktop.  Cytoscape.js is a JavaScript library for _programmers_.  It is not an app for end-users, and developers need to write code around Cytoscape.js to build graphcentric webapps.

Cytoscape.js is a JavaScript library:  It gives you a reusable graph widget that you can integrate with the rest of your webapp with your own JavaScript code.  The keen members of the audience will point out that this means that Cytoscape plugins/apps &mdash; written in Java &mdash; will obviously not work in Cytoscape.js &mdash; written in Java_Script_.  However, Cytoscape.js supports its own ecosystem of UI plugins and API extensions.

We are trying to make the two projects intercompatible as possible, and we do share philosophies with Cytoscape:  Graph style and data should be separate, the library should provide core functionality with extensions adding functionality on top of the library, and so on.
