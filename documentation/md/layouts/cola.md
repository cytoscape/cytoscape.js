The `cola` layout uses a [force-directed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-directed_graph_drawing) physics simulation with several sophisticated constraints, written by [Tim Dwyer](http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~tdwyer/).  For more information about Cola and its parameters, refer to [its documentation](http://marvl.infotech.monash.edu/webcola/).

Because Cola.js is a separate library, the developer must manually include `cola.js` in their app in order to use the `cola` layout.
