The `dagre` layout organises the graph using a DAG (directed acyclic graph) system, written by [Chris Pettitt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrismpettitt).  It is especially suitable for DAGs and trees.  For more information, please refer to its [Dagre's documentation](https://github.com/cpettitt/dagre).

Because Dagre is a separate library, the developer must manually include `dagre.js` in his app in order to use the `dagre` layout.
