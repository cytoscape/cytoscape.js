The spread layout uses a force-directed physics simulation with several external libraries.  The layout tries to keep elements spread out evenly, making good use of constrained space.

The layout makes use of [foograph.js](https://code.google.com/p/foograph/) and [rhill-voronoi-core.js](https://github.com/gorhill/Javascript-Voronoi).
