The `springy` layout uses a [force-directed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-directed_graph_drawing) physics simulation, written by [Dennis Hotson](http://dhotson.tumblr.com/).  For more information about Springy and its parameters, refer to [its documentation](http://getspringy.com).

Because Springy.js is a separate library, the developer must manually include `springy.js` in their app in order to use the `springy` layout.
