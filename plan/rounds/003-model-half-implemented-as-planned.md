## Model half — implemented as planned

Columns, flag bits and shape ids are exactly as originally specced; `contract.mts` is the co-signed source of truth and was implemented first. Key decisions that held up:

- **Stable slots**: free-list + tombstones (cleared flags) + per-slot generation counters; renderer draws `highWater` instances, dead ones collapse to degenerate quads in the VS. No compaction in pass 1 (since landed: the slot-stable tier round 11, slot-moving round 19).
- **Dirty tracking**: one coalesced `[min,end)` span per column per frame + `resized` flag; `takeDelta()` returns-and-clears; `onInvalidate(cb)` fires ≤ once per microtask. Extended with `touch()` so non-column sidecars (labels) join the same scheduling.
- **Adjacency**: incremental per-node `outEdges[]`/`inEdges[]` (O(1) degree, cascade removal). CSR deferred.
- **Element handles**: interned singleton length-1 collections per live slot; `{group, slot, gen}` refs validated on access; cached `id()`/`group()` stay readable after removal (needed for `remove` events).
- **Events**: single core emitter (v3's `src/emitter.mts` unmodified at pass 1; v4's own since round 41.2) with per-ref listeners for collections and selector qualifiers for the core. Emitted: add, remove, position (skipped when no listeners), select, unselect, zoom, pan, viewport, fit, layoutstart/ready/stop, style, render, destroy, error, tap, mouseover/mouseout.
  - **No event namespaces**: v4 drops namespaced events (`'tap.foo'`) — they are unused and cost a per-emit parse on the hot path. This line long claimed the shared emitter's namespace parsing was "retained for v3 and simply not exercised by v4"; round 37.4 **measured** that and found it fully exercised, in v3 semantics, because v4 imported that emitter. Round 41.2 gave v4 its own, which matches a type whole — so `'tap.ns'` is one literal name now. Listeners/emits should use plain type names.
- **Style**: constant blocks on `node|edge|*|#id` + `:selected/:unselected`; node channels background-color/width/height/shape/opacity/border-*, edge line-color/width/opacity; **plus label/font-size/color** (label sidecar, `data(id)` allowed). Applied on setBlocks, add, and select/unselect. Equal-radii ellipses compile to the exact circle SDF.
- **Grid layout**: cell-packing math ported verbatim; bulk `store.setPositions` (one dirty span) + layout events; `cy.layout({name})` errors on anything but `grid`.
- **Positions**: Float32 canonical; headless dims via `headlessWidth/headlessHeight` (800×600 defaults).
